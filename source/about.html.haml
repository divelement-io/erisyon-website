        Charting the new era of proteomics
    .box.shadow
        %p
            Erisyon Inc. is commercializing the world’s first single molecule protein sequencer that promises to revolutionize the study of proteins. The technology brings many of the features of next generation genomic sequencing (NGS) to the field of proteomics such as high sensitive identification, high throughput and digital quantification of protein molecules in a biological sample. Applications for a proteomic platform technology exist in multiple billion dollar markets, from therapies and diagnostics for immuno-oncology to improvement in crop yields.

            Inheriting work developed over the course of the past decade at the University of Texas Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology in Austin, Erisyon was founded in March 2018 by a group of technologists and entrepreneurs with the ambition to usher in new discoveries that make the world healthier, safer, and more abundant.
