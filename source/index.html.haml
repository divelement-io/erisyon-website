            Fluorosequencing is a single molecule protein sequencing technology that offers the capability to catalogue and quantify every single peptide and protein molecule present in a biological sample. The technology opens up many applications in biology, such as characterizing the antigenic peptides on clinical tumor biopsies for cancer vaccine therapies, single cell proteomics or early detection of biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases.
